# Microsoft Imagine Cup 2025 - Video Submission Guidelines

## 1. Pitch Video (Max 3 Minutes)
**Format**: You (and your team) talking to the camera.
**Goal**: Persuade judges/investors that your problem is real and your solution is viable.
**Do NOT**: Show code or deep technical demos here. Focus on the "Why".

### Pitch Structure:
*   **The Hook**: "Did you know that traffic delays cause X% of preventable deaths in India?"
*   **The Problem**: "Ambulances get stuck, hospitals are unprepared, and golden hour is lost."
*   **The Solution**: "Introducing Saving Lives (HMS). An AI-integrated ecosystem that connects Patients, Ambulances, and Hospitals instantly."
*   **The Tech**: "Powered by Azure OpenAI for verification, IoT Hubs for tracking, and Communication Services for alerts."
*   **The Impact**: "We reduce response times by 40%..."

## 2. Demo Video (Max 2 Minutes) - CRITICAL
**Format**: Screen recording of the **functioning software**.
**Goal**: Prove it works and show off Azure AI.
**Rules**: No slides. No "concept" animations. Real (or simulated real) software usage.

### Recommended Script (2:00 Timeline):

**0:00 - 0:20: The Accident (Patient App)**
*   **Visual**: Patient logs in (Glassmorphism UI). Clicks "Book Ambulance".
*   **Action**: Uploads a photo of the accident.
*   **Voiceover**: *"When an accident occurs, the patient reports it instantly. Our app allows them to upload a scene photo, which is immediately processed by Azure OpenAI."*

**0:20 - 0:50: AI Verification (The "Magic" Moment)**
*   **Visual**: Show the backend log or a UI toast saying "AI Verification: Verified (True)".
*   **Action**: Show the booking confirm.
*   **Voiceover**: *"To prevent false alarms, Azure OpenAI analyzes the image in real-time. Once verified, the request is prioritized and sent to our emergency fleet."*

**0:50 - 1:20: The Rescue (Paramedic / IoT)**
*   **Visual**: Switch to Paramedic View. See "New Trip Assigned". Click for details.
*   **Action**: Maybe show the "Simulated SMS/Push" log in the corner to prove notification.
*   **Voiceover**: *"The nearest ambulance is auto-dispatched based on location. The paramedic receives the patient's vitals and accident data before arrival, preparing them for the specific emergency."*

**1:20 - 2:00: The Hospital (Admin Dashboard)**
*   **Visual**: Show the Main Dashboard (Charts, Maps, Active Trips).
*   **Action**: Hover over the live map or charts.
*   **Voiceover**: *"Meanwhile, the hospital admin tracks the fleet in real-time. This seamless connection ensures the trauma team is ready when the ambulance arrives. This is the future of emergency response."*

## Technical Check for Video:
1.  **Resolution**: Record in 1080p.
2.  **Audio**: Use a clear microphone. Avoid background noise.
3.  **Text**: If your UI text is small, zoom in slightly during recording.

## 3. Pitch Deck (Required)
**Format**: PDF or PPTX.
**Length**: Max **15 Slides**.
**Content**:
1.  **Problem Statement**: What are you solving?
2.  **Solution**: High-level overview.
3.  **Architecture Diagram**: **CRITICAL**. Show how Azure OpenAI, Communication Services, and Database connect.
4.  **Tech Stack**: List all Azure services used.
5.  **Market/Impact**: Who is this for?
6.  **Team**: Who are you?
