CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

The healthcare industry is undergoing a profound digital transformation, driven by the need for greater efficiency, improved patient outcomes, and more accessible, patient-centric services. In this context, a Hospital Management System (HMS) has become an indispensable tool. The Shree Medicare HMS project was born out of the necessity to create a holistic solution that not only addresses the administrative and clinical needs of a hospital but also extends its services directly to patients through their mobile devices. Furthermore, this system integrates cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence not as a single feature, but as a foundational layer of assistance woven throughout the application to augment human capabilities, providing intelligent assistance in critical areas like emergency response, patient triage, clinical documentation, and administrative tasks.

This project is a comprehensive, full-stack solution encompassing a primary web application for staff and administrators, and a native Android application for patients. This dual-platform approach ensures that while the hospital's internal operations are managed with robust, desktop-class tools, patients are engaged through a convenient and accessible mobile interface.

The scope of this project is vast, covering the entire patient journey. It digitizes and integrates everything from initial registration and appointment booking (both in-person and virtual) to emergency response with real-time ambulance tracking and AI-driven insights, long-term care with immunization records, diagnosis, treatment, billing, and follow-up. By providing dedicated portals and applications for patients, doctors, paramedics, and administrators, the system ensures that every stakeholder has the right information and tools at their fingertips. This report will delve into the technical and functional aspects of the Shree Medicare HMS, providing a clear and thorough overview of its architecture, cross-platform implementation, and transformative potential.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 Existing System and Its Limitations

A survey of existing systems reveals a reliance on processes that are ill-equipped for the demands of modern healthcare. The key limitations include:

- Fragmented Operations: The use of separate, non-integrated software for different departments (e.g., one for billing, another for lab results) creates data silos, leading to inefficiency and errors.
- Lack of Mobility and Patient Access: Traditional systems are often confined to the hospital's internal network. Patients have no direct, real-time access to their own health data, appointment schedules, or communication channels, leading to a disconnected and disempowering experience.
- Inefficient Emergency Response: Emergency services often rely on voice communication, leading to delays in dispatch, inaccurate location information, and a lack of real-time visibility for the patient and the hospital. The absence of intelligent assistance in triage and incident assessment can further exacerbate these issues.
- High Administrative Burden: Staff are often bogged down with repetitive administrative tasks, from drafting routine emails and reports to manually summarizing clinical notes for different audiences. This reduces time available for patient care.
- Barriers to Care: Geographic distance and mobility issues can be significant barriers to receiving timely medical advice. The lack of integrated telemedicine solutions forces patients to travel for even minor consultations.

2.2 Proposed System and Its Advantages

The Shree Medicare HMS is proposed as a unified, multi-platform solution to these challenges, significantly enhanced by integrated AI capabilities.

- Unified Web and Mobile Platforms: By providing a core web application for staff and a Capacitor-based Android app for patients, the system ensures seamless data flow and a consistent experience. A doctor can update a record on the web, and the patient can instantly see the update on their phone.
- Comprehensive Feature Integration: The system integrates traditional HMS modules with advanced features like telemedicine, EMS management, and immunization tracking into a single, cohesive platform.
- Real-Time Emergency Management with AI: The EMS module provides a live map for tracking ambulances, an efficient dispatch system for paramedics, and a mobile interface for patients to request and monitor emergency help. Crucially, AI assists dispatchers with incident summaries and ER staff with acuity assessments, while paramedics benefit from AI-generated handover reports.
- Proactive Health Management: The immunization module helps patients and doctors stay on top of vaccination schedules with automated reminders and a clear digital record.
- Accessible Healthcare through Telemedicine: The virtual consultation module breaks down geographical barriers, allowing patients to connect with doctors remotely for diagnosis and advice, saving time and travel costs.
- Pervasive Intelligent Assistance: AI is woven into the fabric of the application. It powers a patient-facing symptom checker, drafts administrative emails for new hires and payroll, generates patient-friendly summaries of complex medical information, creates reorder requests for inventory, and provides a general "co-pilot" for staff, dramatically improving efficiency and communication.

CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM DESIGN

4.1 System Architecture

The system is built on a Full-Stack + Mobile Hybrid Architecture. This modern approach combines a traditional three-tier architecture for the core web service with a hybrid mobile application strategy for the patient-facing app.

- Presentation Tier (Frontend): A dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. This frontend serves two purposes:
    1.  It is the primary user interface for the web application, accessed via a browser by hospital staff.
    2.  It is the web view core of the Android application, bundled into a native shell by Capacitor.
- Logic Tier (Backend): A robust RESTful API server built on Node.js with the Express.js framework. This is the single source of truth for all business logic, data processing, and database interaction for both the web and mobile clients. It also orchestrates all AI interactions, sending contextual data to the AI service and returning the response to the frontend.
- Data Tier (Database): A MySQL relational database provides persistent storage for all application data.
- Mobile Tier (Capacitor): Capacitor acts as a bridge that takes the entire React web application and bundles it into a native Android project. It provides an API to access native device features (like GPS or camera, if needed) from the JavaScript code, offering a near-native experience.

[INSERT FIGURE 1: DETAILED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM]
(This figure should illustrate the complete architecture: A user on a browser and a user on an Android phone both making requests that go to the single Node.js API backend, which then communicates with the MySQL database. AI services should be shown as an external integration with the backend.)

4.2 Database Design

The database schema is extensive, designed to support the wide range of features. In addition to standard HMS tables, it includes:

- virtual_consultations: Stores details of telemedicine sessions, including meeting links, start/end times, and notes.
- immunization_records: Tracks all vaccinations for each patient, including the vaccine name, date administered, and next due date.
- ems_incidents: Logs all emergency incidents, linking patients, personnel, and vehicles. Includes fields for AI-generated summaries and acuity assessments.
- ems_vehicles: Manages the fleet of ambulances, including their status and live location data.
- ems_personnel: Stores information about paramedics and their assignments.
- lab_tests & lab_results: Manages laboratory tests and their outcomes.

5.3 Pervasive AI "Co-Pilot" Features

Artificial Intelligence is integrated throughout the application to assist staff and patients. All AI interactions are orchestrated by the `aiService.cjs` backend module, which communicates with the Google Gemini API.

- **AI Symptom Checker (Patient-Facing):**
    -   **Implementation:** `TriageChatModal.tsx` provides the UI, while the `triage.cjs` backend service contains a specialized system prompt that instructs the AI to act as a symptom checker and provide a departmental recommendation with a mandatory medical disclaimer.
- **General AI Assistant (Staff-Facing):**
    -   **Implementation:** `AIAssistantModal.tsx` is a reusable component that can be passed context (like patient records). The generic `aiService.cjs` backend handles these requests, allowing staff to ask complex questions about the provided data.
- **AI-Powered Summaries and Explanations:**
    -   **Pre-Consultation Summary:** In `AppointmentsView.tsx`, a button triggers a call to the AI service with the patient's reason for visit, generating a concise summary for the doctor.
    -   **Patient-Friendly Diagnosis Summary:** `MedicalRecordsModule.tsx` uses the AI to translate a clinical diagnosis and treatment plan into simple, reassuring language for patients.
    -   **Lab Test Explainer:** `LaboratoryModule.tsx` uses the AI to provide a simple explanation of what a lab test is for.
- **AI-Powered Administrative Drafting:**
    -   **Employee Onboarding Email:** `EmployeeManagement.tsx` sends new employee details to the AI to draft a complete welcome email.
    -   **Inventory Reorder Request:** `InventoryModule.tsx` uses the AI to draft a professional reorder email for low-stock items.
    -   **Financial Reminders:** `AccountingModule.tsx` uses the AI to draft polite payment reminder messages.
    -   **Patient Welcome SMS:** `PatientManagement.tsx` uses the AI to generate a friendly welcome SMS for new patients.
    -   **Payroll Notification:** `PayrollModule.tsx` uses the AI to draft an email notifying an employee that their salary has been processed.
- **AI-Enhanced EMS Workflow:**
    -   **Implementation:** As detailed in the EMS section, the `FleetManagementDashboard.tsx`, `ERDashboard.tsx`, and `ParamedicMode.tsx` components each contain a button that triggers a call to the `aiService.cjs` backend. The backend uses a unique, role-specific system prompt for each case (dispatcher, ER staff, paramedic) to generate the appropriate AI response (Incident Summary, Acuity Assessment, or SBAR Report).

5.4 Android Application Implementation

The native Android application is a cornerstone of the patient-centric approach. It was built not by writing a separate Java/Kotlin codebase, but by using the Capacitor hybrid framework.
- Process:
    1.  The React web application is built into a static dist folder using Vite (npm run build).
    2.  Capacitor is configured via capacitor.config.json, which points to this dist folder as its web directory.
    3.  Capacitor takes these web assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and copies them into a native Android Studio project.
    4.  The core of the Android app is a single Activity that contains a WebView, which loads the React application.
- Result: This approach allows for a single codebase to power both the web and mobile experiences, ensuring rapid development and feature consistency. The com.hms.app package ID is defined in the configuration for the Google Play Store.
